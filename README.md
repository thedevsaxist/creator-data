**Project Title**: Internet Creator Data Scraper - Database Seeding with Deduplication

## Project Objective: 
Develop a robust web scraping tool to systematically collect, deduplicate, and populate a database with detailed information on 100,000+ internet creators from various online platforms. This database will serve as a valuable resource for research, analysis, and business insights while ensuring that each creator is represented by a single entry, regardless of the number of websites they are found on.
Public APIs + Scraping can be used in unison to create the best result. The 'how' is not prescriptive as long as the output meets the project requirements.

The primary goal is to accumulate a substantial dataset with information on a diverse range of creators while avoiding duplicate entries.
